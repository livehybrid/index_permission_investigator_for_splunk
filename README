Splunk All The Things!!

This app was created with the intention of allowing users the ability to check on their own permissions/capabilities and what apps and indexes they have access to, as well as all available indexes and what roles are required to search them.

What you need to do to set this app up:

#####LOOKUPS#####
lookups/index_descriptions.csv
	◦ This lookup includes all of the indexes available to search as well as a brief description. 
	◦ To grab a list of all indexes, run the saved search: index_information. See SAVED SEARCHES for more information.
	◦ It is best practice to update the lookup table every time a new index is created
		There could be an alert in place when an index exists that is not in this lookup (future enhancement)


#####EVENTTYPES#####
default/eventtypes.conf
	◦ This is not needed for the functionality of the dashboards, however it can be helpful when searching data.
	◦ These eventtypes are various teams/groups/etc. that own various hosts. The purpose of them is so that users can more easily find data owners/subject matter experts. 
	◦ The reason for using eventtypes is so that it can be a search string when there are multiple hosts belonging to one group. If there is only one host, it can be defined in tags.conf
	◦ There is an example in eventtypes.conf of the format.


#####TAGS#####
default/tags.conf
	◦ This is not needed for the functionality of the dashboards, however it can be helpful when searching data.
	◦ These tags include the data owner department and email addresses for the various hosts identified in eventtypes.conf
	◦ As stated in the eventtypes.conf section, if there is only one host and eventtypes aren't needed, it can all be defined solely in tags.conf
	◦ There are examples of both formats in tags.conf


What else to know?
#####SAVED SEARCHES#####
default/savedsearches.conf
	◦ index_information
		◦ This saved search creates a lookup called index_information.csv
		◦ You may need to edit the search to include/exclude specific splunk_servers as necessary, to fit your environments needs
		◦ This lookup is used in the Index Overview dashboard
		◦ This search is scheduled to run once a day
